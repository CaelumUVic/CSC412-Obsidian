## Summary
Social media platforms and digital communication enable users to connect through text, images, and videos across the world. These technologies directly impact empathy by altering how people understand others' emotional states and perspectives. Since 2000, measured levels of [[Perspective-Taking]] and [[Empathic Concern]] have lowered amongst North American adults, correlating heavily with the emergence of social media. In fact, people who score highly in [[Perspective-Taking]] and [[Empathic Concern]], indicating high levels of empathy, are less likely to overuse social media. However, these effects of social media are not universal, and social media has been shown to maintain or increase empathy in Europe and Asia.

While the effects of social media may not be global, the polarization and toxicity online are apparent, and their presence can be linked to a lack of empathy online. This is due to the mechanisms running popular social media platforms are overall ineffective at emulating empathetic connections made in real life. In particular, social media can cause people to be less empathetic by:
- Causing people to spend less time in person with one another, depriving them of chances to practice social skills
- Causing people to highly focus on themselves instead of others 
- Removing [[Social Cues]] from conversations through streamlined communication
- Discouraging authenticity and encouraging anonymity
- Cultural differences in how social media is utilized 
## Applications

In response, social media and digital communication platforms have developed various methods aimed at augmenting, facilitating, and increasing empathy:

- Encouraging Authenticity: Platforms like [[BeReal]] are attempting to make platforms more authentic to build real connections and decrease [[Social Disinhibition]].
- Integrating [[Social Cues]]: The integration of [[Emoticons and Reactions|emoticons and in particular reactions]], has reintroduced [[Social Cues]] which are heavily present and important for empathetic connection.
- Facilitating Community Support: Users on Reddit have created numerous, emotional [[Support Subreddits]] to help others with feelings of depression, anxiety, and more, thereby facilitating empathetic connection online.
- Providing Individualized Support: Many modalities of digital communication have been adopted to provide [[Digital Counselling]] online.
