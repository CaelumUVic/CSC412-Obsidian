## Summary
Digital counselling is a form of therapy delivered through online platforms. While early forms faced challenges with virtual security and limited modalities, modern advances have largely addressed these issues. Today, digital counselling provides a highly accessible, affordable, and effective method for people to receive mental health support. Therapy inherently involves empathy, and its transition to digital spaces has necessitated adaptations in how empathy is expressed and perceived.

## Research
[Empathic Interactions in Online Treatment](https://pure.tue.nl/ws/portalfiles/portal/206960710/ARCTT_2021.pdf)

In a study involving 363 digital therapy practitioners, researchers investigated the differences between digital and in-person therapy. Participants reported that the physical barriers of digital mediums eliminated non-verbal [[Social Cues]] and social interaction rituals. This limitation augmented how practitioners expressed empathy with their patients, causing them to become more explicit in their communication. By adapting to new modalities of therapy delivery, practitioners potentially enhanced certain aspects of cognitive empathy through more deliberate [[Perspective-Taking]] and verbalization.
## Discussion
Digital counselling augments empathic interactions by requiring more explicit communication between therapists and clients. While digital therapy offers advantages in accessibility and affordability, it is limited in conveying subtle aspects of human interaction. Additional concerns include security and ensuring quality treatment across platforms. A promising area of development involves [[AI Virtual Companions]] acting as therapeutic assistants, offering advantages such as privacy and constant availability. Overall, digital counselling represents an important evolution in mental health support that has adapted empathic practices to thrive in online environments.
