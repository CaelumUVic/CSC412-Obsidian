## Summary
BeReal is a social media platform built to increase the authenticity of their users and help them maintain and form meaningful connections. To do this, BeReal allows users to take photos of themselves and their surroundings at random times throughout the day. This mechanism doesn’t allow users to stage or edit their photography, building trust and empathy by encouraging authenticity.

While no research has attempted to use BeReal to [[Empathy Building|build empathy]] within its participants. There is a strong collection of research to indicate that BeReal does drive authenticity which is highly correlated with the development of other positive traits like empathy

BeReal is marketed as being the most authentic or "real" social media available. This claim to realism is achieved through the use of their unique feature of encouraging users to take photographs of their immediate surroundings. This approach successfully fosters an authentic experience between its users. By becoming more authentic, users likely are also developing other positive traits like empathy and gratitude. Those positive traits have been found to be highly correlated when research has attempted to find a link between them. Therefore, by enforcing authenticity BeReal is also helping its users foster empathy.
## Discussion
While BeReal may help build empathy amongst its user base, that is not its explicit purpose, and it is not intentionally designed to. BeReal is limited by its design because it only focuses on keeping people real, and has no intention to be a tool that builds empathy. However, by fostering positive traits like authenticity, BeReal is augmenting its user base to be more empathetic towards each other.
