## Summary

Reddit is a community of people online that is partitioned into smaller groups or subreddits. Subreddits are focused around topics that users can elect to join. A number of those subreddits are focused around mental health and providing support to others. Within these subreddits, users are able to receive mental health support, and those who receive support are more likely to provide empathetic support to others.

## Research
**[Social Support and Empathy in Online Mental Health Communities](https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18136855)**

In a 2021 study titled “Exploring the Effect of Social Support and Empathy on User Engagement in Online Mental Health Communities”, twenty two subreddits relating to mental health were analysed. In that analysis, users were compared depending on whether or not they received help from the community with their mental health struggles. The study found that users who received help were more likely to post again and provide support to others. These users also demonstrated higher levels of empathy, including [[Perspective-Taking]] and [[Empathic Concern]], towards others after the experience, strongly demonstrating [[Empathy Building]].
## Discussion
Social support communities, like the ones on Reddit, provide valuable places for people to seek help for their mental health struggles. While these subreddits provide a helpful forum for these people, there are some limitations. One such limitation is the limited number of modalities that people on Reddit can receive and express empathy. Additionally, with Reddit being an open forum there is a possibility of abuse from others on the platform. Unfortunately, this is the risk of any public forum, and while many of these communities have moderators, it wouldn’t be possible to perfectly moderate every message. Largely, these communities are positive, and are augmenting their users ability to be empathetic to others.
