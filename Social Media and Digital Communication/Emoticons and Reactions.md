## Summary
Emoticons or emojis, first appeared on computers in the 1990’s to communicate information in a “simple, succinct way”. Since then, emojis were added to Unicode by the Unicode Consortium, and have entered nearly every computer system. In the context of empathy, emoticons can help people express social information, including empathy, in a succinct and meaningful way.

## Research
[Emojis as Social Information](https://doi.org/10.1037/emo0000992)
In a study titled “Emojis as social information in digital communication”, emojis were studied for their ability to convey emotions, clarify discourse, and influence social-emotional responses. It was found that messages containing emojis were more emotionally intense and prompted higher emotional polarity. Additionally, emojis were found to trigger responses that helped users with understanding and [[Empathic Concern]]. Overall, these findings show that emojis are effective at emotionality and clarifying discourse, providing a text-based alternative for face-to-face [[Social Cues]].
## Discussion

Emojis augment empathic cognition by effectively representing emotions, clarifying intent, and indicating state of mind to others. In digital contexts, emojis are the stand in for [[Social Cues]]. Face-to-face communication relies heavily on [[Social Cues]] which provides extra information about the state of mind of others. With this extra information, people can express more [[Empathic Concern]] and respond more appropriately to messages. However, emojis are limited in this context, human emotion exists on a spectrum, and trying to find the correct emoji to convey a specific state of mind may not exist.
