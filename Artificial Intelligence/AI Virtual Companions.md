## Summary

AI-driven virtual companions, such as chatbots, are being used more and more for [[AI in Healthcare|emotional support and mental health care]]. These AI systems provide users with a safe, nonjudgmental space to express emotions, particularly sadness and depressive moods. Unlike [[Social Media and Digital Communication]] or [[Digital Counselling]], where individuals may fear judgment, chatbot interactions offer privacy, anonymity, and 24/7 accessibility. While AI-driven mental health tools show promise in reducing anxiety and depression, concerns still remain in the AI’s ability to provide meaningful emotional support beyond scripted interactions.![](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXfHFFJOr90UViVkzrnAgpD_AgAlsv4JQlIfr2Gir0DOgqjDW9QoETKBeyN_6eVUV-v5Irk3rEIYXvCnG8HHDYMkcjQIl1S3MV6InWpFccwNxcge9t7QvRvkUDKieRP-FUm-DzpU?key=xdfsF3ZC0gzdm0PDx6A8SSZO)
## Research 

[The Potential of Chatbots for Emotional Support and Promoting Mental Well-Being in Different Cultures: Mixed Methods Study](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10625083/)

[Plug-and-play Text-based Emotion Recognition for Chatbots as Virtual Companions for Older People](https://search.library.uvic.ca/discovery/fulldisplay?docid=cdi_ieee_primary_10187822&context=PC&vid=01VIC_INST:01UVIC&lang=en&adaptor=Primo%20Central&tab=LIBALL&query=any%2Ccontains%2CChatbots%20and%20virtual%20companions&offset=0)

A study analyzing 152,783 chatbot-human interactions from the SimSimi chatbot showed how cultural differences in individuals change how they express different emotions. One example is how western users were more likely to openly discuss mental health issues and death compared to others.

Additional research on AI-powered mental health chatbots, such as Woebot and Wysa, has confirmed their effectiveness in reducing anxiety and depression.

## Discussion 

AI-powered virtual companions have shown potential in addressing mental health challenges and social isolation, particularly among elderly individuals. These systems provide companionship, cognitive stimulation, and emotional support, leading to a reduction in loneliness. However, several concerns still remain:

- Cultural Sensitivity: Chatbots should be adapted to cultural differences in emotional expression and mental health discourse.
- Missues: Although this technology can be very useful there are cases where AI chatbots have provided insufficient/bad support leading to death in some cases.**
