## Summary

AI is being used more and more in healthcare to recognize and respond to human emotions, offering support in clinical and mental health settings. Although current AI lacks [[Emotional Empathy]] it can exhibit [[Cognitive Empathy]], making some of its applications more limited. There have been many AI powered technologies developed in recent years such as DORO, which demonstrate many of the benefits to leveraging AI in healthcare. Some things AI is able to accomplish include; assisting individuals feeling stressed, anxiety, and early signs of other mental health conditions. Additionally, strategic use of AI can help alleviate some emotional burnout in healthcare professionals by taking on some of the emotionally demanding aspects of patient care.
## Research 

A study published in PMC explores how AI can help enhance patient care. However, its usage is somewhat limited due to the lack of [[Emotional Empathy]] achievable by current models. Models used now are able to simulate [[Cognitive Empathy]]. The study emphasizes the importance of using iterative AI development, incorporating user feedback to ensure AI tools developed meet the needs of both patients and professionals.

Another application of AI healthcare being developed is DORO, it has been developed at the University of Waterloo and serves as a daily mental health coach by dynamically shifting between different Large Language Models (LLMs) that have been trained on different therapy sessions. Each LLM has a specific function, such as recognizing user emotions or delivering cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) techniques  like cognitive restructuring. This development style has allowed DORO to provide tailored mental health support to each user.

## Discussion 

The integration of AI in healthcare presents both opportunities and challenges:

- Alleviating Burnout: AI can reduce the emotional burden on healthcare providers by handling some parts of patient interactions.
    
- Mental Health Accessibility: Specific AI tools like DORO help bridge the gap between early intervention and therapy by providing quick support to individuals.
    
- Ethical Concerns: The use of AI in mental health raises concerns about data privacy, AI bias, and the authenticity of machine-generated empathy.
    
- Limits of AI Empathy: While AI can recognize emotions, it cannot experience them, making it difficult to fully replace human interactions in healthcare settings. Just like in any kind of [[ digital counseling ]]
    
Despite its limitations, AI has the potential to be a great support tool in healthcare by enhancing emotional recognition, improving mental health accessibility, and reducing professional burnout. However, the main challenge of ensuring AI complements rather than replaces human care in emotionally sensitive environments.
