## Summary

AI is being used more and more in healthcare to recognize and respond to human emotions. Although current AI lacks [[Emotional Empathy]] it can exhibit [[Cognitive Empathy]], making some of its applications more limited. An example of this kind of AI powered technology developed in recent years is DORO. Some things DORO is currently able to accomplish include; assisting individuals feeling stressed or experiencing anxiety along with noticing early signs of other mental health conditions. It has been found that use of AI like DORO can help alleviate some emotional burnout in healthcare professionals by taking on some of the more emotionally demanding aspects of patient care.
## Research 
A study published in PMC explores how an AI can help enhance patient care. However, its usage is somewhat limited due to the lack of [[Emotional Empathy]] achievable by current models. Models used now are only able to simulate [[Cognitive Empathy]].

DORO was developed at the University of Waterloo and serves as a daily mental health coach. It accomplishes this by shifting between different Large Language Models (LLMs) that have been trained on different therapy sessions. Each LLM has a specific function, such as recognizing user emotions or delivering cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) techniques. This development style has allowed DORO to provide tailored mental health support to individual users.

## Discussion 

The integration of AI in healthcare presents both opportunities and challenges:

- **Alleviating Burnout:** AI can reduce the emotional burden on healthcare providers by handling some parts of patient interactions.
    
- **Mental Health Accessibility:** Specific AI tools like DORO help bridge the gap between early intervention and therapy by providing immediate support to individuals.
    
- **Ethical Concerns:** The use of AI in mental health raises concerns about data privacy, AI bias, and the authenticity of machine-generated empathy.
    
- **Limits of AI Empathy:** While AI can recognize emotions, it cannot experience them, making it difficult to fully replace human interactions in healthcare settings.
    
Despite its limitations, these AIs have the potential to be a great support tool in healthcare by enhancing emotional recognition, improving mental health accessibility, and reducing professional burnout.
