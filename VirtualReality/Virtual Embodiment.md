## Summary

One of the key components of empathy is [[Terminology/Perspective-Taking]]. For many people, this ability is developed using the imagination, but what if you were to literally step into another person's shoes and see the world through their eyes? 

This idea has been made possible through a process known as *virtual embodiment*, where a VR user experiences the feeling of being inside a virtual body (or avatar) that is not their own. Virtual embodiment involves having a sense of body ownership, self-location, and agency to provide as complete of an experience as possible. To accomplish these experiences, most virtual embodiment tools consist of a combination of the following components. 

1. **Head-Mounted Display (HMD)**: Provides the immersive first-person perspective and tracks head movements to align vision with the virtual body (avatar).
2. **Full-Body Motion Tracker**: Tracks body movements and translates them onto the virtual avatar in real time.
3. **Hand and Finger Tracking**: Enables users to interact with objects in VR naturally and with fine motor control.
4. **Haptic Devices**: To simulate sensations such as touch, force, or pressure.

Studies that use virtual embodiment as an empathy tool often incorporate a virtual mirror to reinforce the sense of body ownership. Additionally, many experimental designs include an introductory exercise where users familiarize themselves with their virtual bodies by performing simple movements, such as raising their hands or walking, to strengthen the illusion of embodiment before engaging in perspective-taking scenarios.

## Research 

1. [Offenders become the victim in virtual reality: impact of changing perspective in domestic violence](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-19987-7)

	In this study, researchers found that having male domestic abusers embody a female victim in a scene of domestic abuse improved their ability to correctly identify emotions such as fear in female faces.

	Researchers found that light-skinned participants who experienced a virtual reality environment in dark-skinned virtual bodies experienced a decrease in implicit racial bias as measured by a racial Implicit Association Test

## Discussion 

In these studies, virtual embodiment has been used as a tool to augment empathy by forcing participants to engage in a literal form of perspective-taking. But what areas of empathy are actually being exercised and improved? In the first study, it is shown that [[Cognitive Empathy ]](i.e. being able to correctly identify emotions) in male offenders for female victims is being improved through experiencing a scenario which evokes [[Emotional Empathy]] for those same victims. By experiencing a situation from the perspective of the victim, the perpetrator is likely to feel similar emotions that the victim would, in turn making them better able to identify those emotions in the real world. The second study follows much of the same reasoning, showing outcomes of greater empathy towards minorities in participants through reduced bias.

However, virtual embodiment as a tool for augmenting empathy has several limitations. Perhaps the most significant is its inability to replace real lived experience. While it can simulate physical experiences, it does not provide access to an individualâ€™s emotions, cognitive framework, or personal history. In other words, it fails to improve certain aspect of [[Theory of Mind]] - an important part of empathy. Additionally, not all participants will respond to virtual embodiment in the same way. Some may struggle to feel empathy and instead experience discomfort, skepticism, or resistance. Moreover, prolonged exposure to suffering or distress in VR can lead to [[Emotional Fatigue]] or detachment rather than increased empathy. Therefore, while virtual embodiment offers valuable insights into perspective-taking, it is not a complete solution for fostering mutual understanding between different groups.
