## Summary 

Virtual reality (VR) is a technology that immerses users in digital environments, creating a strong sense of presence and interaction. While many people think of VR as being used for entertainment, it has also been studied as a tool for enhancing empathy by allowing users to experience perspectives different from their own - a process known as [[Perspective-Taking]]. By simulating real-world scenarios, VR can help people understand the emotions, challenges, and experiences of others in a more visceral way. This has applications in education, social awareness, and therapy.

## Applications

VR has been used to foster empathy through various approaches, including virtual embodiment, immersive storytelling, and perspective-taking simulations. These applications span education, healthcare, social awareness, and therapy, helping users understand different lived experiences. Below are specific examples you can explore relating to VRâ€™s role in empathy augmentation.

1. [[Virtual Embodiment]]: Use full-body illusion techniques to make users feel as if they have literally stepped into the shoes of another person, thereby changing their perceived self-identity. This method is often used in studies on bias reduction, perspective-taking, and body ownership.

2. **Narrative-Driven Immersion**: Use storytelling and passive observation to create emotional connections with real people or fictional characters. They are often presented as 360-degree videos or interactive documentaries which encourage users to witness and reflect on experiences different from their own.
