## Link to Empathy

Perspective-taking is a key component of empathy, as it enables individuals to recognize and understand the emotional states of others. By adopting another person’s viewpoint, we gain insight into their feelings and experiences, which allows us to respond with greater emotional sensitivity. This ability strengthens interpersonal connections and fosters a deeper sense of compassion, as it moves beyond intellectual understanding to genuine emotional connection.
