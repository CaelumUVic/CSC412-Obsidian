## Link to Empathy

Social disinhibition can shape empathy in opposing ways depending on the setting. On one hand, it can diminish empathy and may lead to impulsive, insensitive, or aggressive behaviour, reducing concern for others. Conversely, certain disinhibiting environments (e.g., therapeutic settings, virtual reality experiences, or emotionally immersive storytelling) can lower social barriers, encouraging greater emotional expression and deeper connection with others. The impact depends on whether the disinhibited state fosters emotional detachment or increased openness to othersâ€™ experiences.
