## Link to Empathy

Experiencing emotional fatigue can decrease one's ability to experience empathy or feel compassion towards others. In extreme cases, it can lead to empathic distress, where individuals avoid or detach from emotional situations to protect themselves. This is especially relevant in caregiving professions, where sustained empathy can lead to burnout if not managed properly.
