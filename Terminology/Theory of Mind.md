## Link to Empathy

Theory of mind is integral to empathy because it enables us to understand that others have thoughts, beliefs, and emotions that differ from our own. This awareness is important for emotional resonance, as it allows us to interpret and predict how others might feel or react in a given situation. By recognizing that others' experiences are shaped by their unique mental states, we can respond in ways that better acknowledge their emotions and experiences.
