## Link to Empathy

Empathy building involves the active development of empathic abilities through structured practices and meaningful experiences. This process strengthens one's capacity to understand others' perspectives and respond with appropriate emotional concern. Through exposure to diverse viewpoints, [[Perspective-taking]] exercises, and intentional practice, individuals enhance both their [[Cognitive Empathy]] and [[Empathic Concern]]. Effective empathy building leads to improved interpersonal relationships and increased prosocial behavior.
