## Link to Empathy

Cognitive empathy provides a first step in being able to empathize with others. It is impossible to feel what others are feeling without first identifying what emotions they could be experiencing and why. This ability enables more effective interpersonal communication, making it easier to anticipate and respond to othersâ€™ needs in a thoughtful and considerate manner.
