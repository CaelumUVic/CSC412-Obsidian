## Link to Empathy

Social cues help individuals interpret others' emotions and intentions, which is essential for empathy. Recognizing these cues enables both [[Cognitive Empathy]] and [[Emotional Empathy]]. A lack of social cue awareness, as seen in conditions like autism or in digital communication, can make empathic responses more challenging. Conversely, strong sensitivity to social cues can enhance emotional connections and social bonding.
