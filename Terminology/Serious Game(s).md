## Definition

Serious games are games specifically designed with educational or socially beneficial objectives in mind, rather than purely for entertainment. They often incorporate real-world issues, simulations, or skill-building activities to help players learn, practice, or understand complex concepts like [[Empathy]], [[Perspective-Taking]], [[Social Cues]] and [[Communication]] in a more engaging way.

## Link To Empathy 

By placing players in unfamiliar situations or roles, serious games can foster [[Empathy]] by allowing individuals to experience perspectives different from their own. This immersive quality helps players develop understanding and compassion toward othersâ€™ viewpoints, challenges, and contexts.
