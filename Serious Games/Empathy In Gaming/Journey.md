## Discussion

- **[[Cognitive Empathy]]**  
    The lack of explicit dialogue forces players to interpret the robed figure’s motivations. This “reading between the lines” aspect encourages a rational, imaginative engagement with the silent protagonist’s journey.
    
- **[[Emotional Empathy]]**  
    The game’s music and stunning visuals evoke awe and companionship. Encountering another anonymous player and traveling together can foster a bond rooted in shared experience rather than words.
    
- **[[Emotional Fatigue]]**  
    Although Journey is more uplifting than bleak, players may still feel moments of desperation and loss (particularly in the harsher environments). The repeated cycle of struggle and triumph can create subtle waves of fatigue that make the final success more meaningful.
    
- **[[Perspective-Taking]]**  
    Journey invites players to see the world through the lens of discovery and quiet cooperation. The experience encourages thinking about someone else’s motives and constraints without explicit communication.
    
- **[[Serious Game(s)]]**  
    While not explicitly designed as a serious game, Journey’s emphasis on emotional connection and subtle communication elevates it beyond standard entertainment. It facilitates reflection on themes of cooperation, empathy, and shared humanity.
    
- **[[Social Cues]]**  
    In-game encounters revolve around nonverbal cues—like chirps or body language—to coordinate movement. These simplified social cues reduce typical online disinhibition, focusing instead on genuine collaboration and support between strangers.
