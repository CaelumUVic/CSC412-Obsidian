**Overview**  
Depression Quest is an interactive fiction game focused on portraying the day-to-day experiences of living with depression. It uses text-based scenarios and choice limitations that mirror the condition’s impact.

## How Depression Quest Augments Empathy 

[[Cognitive Empathy]]  
By restricting available choices—similar to how depression can limit one’s perceived options—players gain insight into the cognitive distortions that accompany mental health struggles.

[[Emotional Empathy]]
The personal tone of the narrative fosters a sense of closeness to the protagonist’s emotional state. Frequent descriptions of sadness, isolation, and anxiety can stir a strong empathetic response.

[[Emotional Fatigue]]
Players may experience a sense of heaviness or fatigue as they repeatedly navigate low-motivation scenarios. This can simulate a fraction of the long-term burden depression imposes on real individuals.

[[Perspective-Taking]]
Through first-person accounts, Depression Quest encourages players to see the world from the lens of someone with a mental health condition. The text-based format deepens the player’s immersion in the protagonist’s thought patterns.
