## Summary
On the topic of [[Serious Games and Empathy]] Depression Quest is an interactive fiction game focused on portraying the day-to-day experiences of living with depression. It uses text-based scenarios and choice limitations that mirror the condition’s impact.

## Applications 

A Study titled [Social and Cognitive Affordances of Two Depression-Themed Games](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1555412017742307) analyzed player-generated discussions to explore the social and cognitive effects of "Depression Quest" and "Actual Sunlight." The findings suggest that such games can foster empathy and provide insight into the experiences of individuals living with depression.

## Discussion
- **[[Cognitive Empathy]]**  
	By restricting available choices—similar to how depression can limit one’s perceived options—players gain insight into the cognitive distortions that accompany mental health struggles.
    
- **[[Emotional Empathy]]**  
	The personal tone of the narrative fosters a sense of closeness to the protagonist’s emotional state. Frequent descriptions of sadness, isolation, and anxiety can stir a strong empathetic response.
    
- **[[Emotional Fatigue]]**  
	Players may experience a sense of heaviness or fatigue as they repeatedly navigate low-motivation scenarios. This can simulate a fraction of the long-term burden depression imposes on real individuals.
    
- **[[Perspective-Taking]]**  
	Through first-person accounts, Depression Quest encourages players to see the world from the lens of someone with a mental health condition. The text-based format deepens the player’s immersion in the protagonist’s thought patterns.
