## Discussion

- **[[Cognitive Empathy]]**: By gradually revealing the characters’ struggles—such as scarcity of resources or unpredictable encounters—players learn to understand the protagonist family’s mindset. This cognitive engagement prompts players to consider rational decision-making in dire circumstances.​
    
- **[[Emotional Empathy]]**: The bleak environment and frequent setbacks allow players to empathize with the family’s despair. The emotional toll heightens when critical choices, such as sacrificing water for a child, force players to feel what the family might feel.​
    
- **[[Emotional Fatigue]]**: Repeatedly experiencing the family’s losses and near-escapes can lead to emotional fatigue. Over time, the cycle of hope and despair mirrors real-world refugee crises, underscoring the human cost of displacement.​
    
- **[[Perspective-Taking]]**: The game’s narrative structure nudges players to imagine being in the shoes of migrants, prompting reflection on actual migrant experiences. This perspective shift can challenge preconceived notions about migration.​
    
- **[[Serious Game(s)]]**: Cloud Chasers is categorized as a serious game because it aims to raise awareness of migration issues and climate challenges. While providing entertainment, it also pushes players to engage with social and political realities.​
    
- **[[Social Cues]]**: Limited social interactions in the game place emphasis on reading the subtle cues of desperation (e.g., rationing water, avoiding hostile encounters). Players might find themselves considering morally ambiguous actions, revealing how dire situations can lower social inhibitions.​
