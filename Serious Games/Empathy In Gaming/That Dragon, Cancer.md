## Summary  
That Dragon, Cancer is a deeply personal game created by parents of a young child with terminal cancer. It chronicles their emotional journey and the complexities of caring for a sick loved one.

## Applications

- [[Cognitive Empathy]]  
	Players learn about the difficult choices and emotional toll on the parents, encouraging them to rationally engage with medical, financial, and emotional realities that come with terminal illness.

- [[Emotional Empathy]]
	The game’s intimate storytelling—voice recordings, heartfelt scenes, and raw vulnerability—evokes a profound sense of empathy. The urgency and helplessness of the situation can leave a lasting emotional impact.

- [[Emotional Fatigue]]
	Because it deals with terminal illness, the game can be emotionally draining. Experiencing the parents’ highs and lows over and over can simulate the relentless stress and emotional exhaustion of real-life caregivers.

- [[Perspective-Taking]]
	By walking through the family’s experiences, players are prompted to see the world from the viewpoint of someone caring for a child with cancer. This perspective helps convey both the deep sadness and the hope that families may cling to.

- [[Serious Game(s)]] 
	Despite its personal origins, That Dragon, Cancer can also be regarded as a serious game. Its goal is to raise awareness of the emotional realities of terminal illness and encourage empathy for families in similar positions.

- [[Social Cues]]
	In this intimate context, social cues revolve around the parents’ interactions with healthcare providers, family, and each other. The rawness of their grief might challenge typical social norms around discussing death, highlighting how crisis can lower social inhibitions about expressing emotion.
