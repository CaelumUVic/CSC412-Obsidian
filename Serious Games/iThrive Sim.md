## Summary

iThrive Sim lives within the group of  [[Serious Game(s)]] designed to foster cognitive and emotional empathy, improve [[communication]] and [[Perspective-Taking]], and engage young people in civic learning. Developed by iThrive Games Foundation, this simulation-based platform provides interactive, role-playing experiences where players navigate real-world dilemmas through collaborative decision-making. By immersing players in complex social and political issues, iThrive Sim encourages deeper engagement with [[Empathy]]-driven leadership, problem-solving, and media literacy.

## Research

[[Serious Game(s)]] like [[iThrive Sim]]  are increasingly recognized for their role in developing cognitive and [[emotional empathy]]. Research in game-based learning highlights how virtual simulations enhance perspective-taking by placing players in roles where they must consider different viewpoints. [studies](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/344948442_Cognitive_Load_and_Empathy_in_Serious_Games) on [[cognitive empathy]] show that structured role-play in digital environments can improve users' ability to anticipate and understand others' thoughts and motivations. Additionally, research on [[emotional empathy]] suggests that interacting with simulated characters experiencing distress or conflict can strengthen an individual’s capacity for compassion and social connection.

The effectiveness of tools like iThrive Sim is also supported by studies on [[communication]] and [[social cues]] in virtual spaces. Digital role-playing games encourage players to interpret non-verbal cues, adapt their communication strategies, and engage in collaborative problem-solving. 

## Discussion

iThrive Sim’s emphasis on [[Perspective-Taking]] and social awareness makes it a valuable tool for developing key social and emotional skills. Unlike traditional learning methods, the interactive nature of simulations allows users to **actively practice empathy**, rather than passively learning about it. By engaging with diverse viewpoints and making decisions that impact virtual characters, players refine both their cognitive and emotional empathy in a controlled, yet dynamic environment.

The potential of serious games in [[Virtual Reality and Empathy Augmentation]] could further amplify these effects, offering an even deeper level of immersion. While iThrive Sim currently operates in a browser-based format, integrating VR simulations could heighten emotional engagement by allowing players to physically embody different roles.
