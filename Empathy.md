## Introduction
Empathy is the heart of human connection shaping how we communicate, form relationships, and understand one another. In a world with a rapidly expanding digital world, where human interactions are typically facilitated/augmented by technology, the nature of empathy is constantly evolving along with it. The main question is can technology truly understand and foster empathy, or does it merely stimulate emotional intelligence and reduce empathy? This vault explores the intersection of AI, digital communication, perspective-taking, storytelling, emotion wearables, and serious games.

**Sub-Topics**: each member of our group selected a subtopic that related to the main topic. Each of our subtopics are seen in the figure above. These have #topic at the top of the note.

**Related Technologies**: each member found technologies related to our subtopics that augmented empathy. These have #tool at the top of the note.

**Glossary Terms**: we have many glossary terms each in their own note that we used to connect our notes together. These have #terminology at the top of the note.

While most of our research articles are linked directly in each relevant note, we also have a note for general [[References]], listing resources used for general or background research.
