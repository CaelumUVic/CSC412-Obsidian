## Summary
RealityTalk is a tool for augmenting presentations using keywords to bring up visuals. Previous presentation augmentation tools are usually either post production tools like Adobe or scripted presentations that have a structure. Post production tools do not allow live presentations and the scripted presentations are rigid and lack interactivity or improvisation. RealityTalk uses key words and voice recognition to allow the presenter to have more control over the presentation, allowing them to move animation elements around as they please and be more responsive on questions to attendants.

## Discussion
Having a tool that presenters can use real time to enhance comprehension and understandability to their presentations is very useful for gaining [[emotional empathy]] of listeners. If the listeners could not understand what the presenter is saying, then the content of the presentation is not very useful.
