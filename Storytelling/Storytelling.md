## Summary
Storytelling is a way for humans to share lessons, ideas, and more critically for this research, emotions. Stories are a platform in which humans can connect with each other to find shared experiences between one another. This can promote [[cognitive empathy]], such that the stories can help us experience the emotions of others. For example stories let us experience what it might be like to lose a loved one, or to experience what it is like to win a championship. Stories promote [[perspective-taking]], by hearing stories from those with different backgrounds or views on the world. Storytelling also pushes the notion of [[Humanism]], that you are not alone in this world, and that we should care for each other. 

Storytelling's influence on empathy is rooted in communication, can storytelling help with [[Communication]]?
- This research found that using data storytelling techniques (plot lines, unexpected twists, motivating conclusions, etc.) enhanced comprehension of information for communicating insights from data.

## Applications
### Animation
- Animation allows storytelling to take on new and interesting forms. In history, storytelling has predominately been through verbal stories. Later on stories took the form of writing and allowed stories to be captured and distributed through space and time. With more recent technology like movies taking the main stage in storytelling, it allowed visual elements to be tied with stories. Animation furthers the visual elements of storytelling by enabling more abstract and fictional designs. 
	- [[The Real-Time Frontier]] is an Unreal Engine tool that makes animation much quicker so that artists.
### Presentations
- Presentations are a way to communicate stories that have visual components to augment the engagement and comprehension
	- [[RealityTalk]] us augmented reality to create visualizations based on speech detection.
