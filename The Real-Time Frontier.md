## Summary
The Real Time Frontier propose a simplified pipeline that uses Unreal Engine to create animation 2D and 3D animation scenes in real time. This allows artists to go from concept to reality much quicker then previous animation techniques. The cornerstone to the Real Time Frontier is using 2D objects in 3D scenes, benefiting from the quick computation of 2D objects and immersive feeling of 3D scenes.

They have a "Shot is King" philosophy which is more of a bottom-up approach where each scene is treated almost independently which reduces computation time. They then have a hierarchical system to enact system wide changes lets say for things like character attributes that will be present on many scenes.

	- They have piloted the use of their frontier on a series called "Spice Frontier" which is a family friendly animation series. A trailer can be seen on the link here: [Spice Frontier](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=laIES7iJXko)

## Discussion
This tool still requires a large development team to produce animated videos but is a step further for making animation more accessible by making it less computationally expensive. By making it less computationally expensive artists can create animation projects much quicker, which allows for immersive storytelling using animation to be used more widely. Quicker animation process allows for more stories to be put out in to the world. Which then allows for more [[Perspective-Taking]] and [[Communication]] between people.
