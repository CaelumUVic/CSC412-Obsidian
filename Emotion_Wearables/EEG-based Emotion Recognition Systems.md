## Summary

EEG-based emotion recognition systems utilize **electroencephalography (EEG) sensors** to measure **electrical activity in the brain**, allowing for the detection and classification of emotional states. By analyzing **brainwave frequency bands (Alpha, Beta, Theta, Delta, and Gamma)**, these systems help researchers and clinicians understand **emotional processing, stress responses, and cognitive load**.

These technologies are increasingly integrated into **mental health treatments, neurofeedback training, and immersive gaming experiences**, making them pivotal tools in **cognitive augmentation**.

- **Neurofeedback Therapy for Anxiety & ADHD:** EEG systems are used in cognitive-behavioral therapy to train patients to regulate brainwave patterns associated with anxiety and hyperactivity.
- **Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) Development:** Emotion recognition from EEG is critical in assistive technology, enabling users to control devices using brain activity.
- **Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) & UX Optimization:** EEG-based emotional tracking is applied in usability testing and adaptive software that adjusts interfaces based on user cognitive load.
- **Immersive Virtual Reality & Gaming:** EEG sensors are integrated into VR environments to adapt gameplay difficulty and narratives in response to player emotions.


## Discussion

- EEG systems can help individuals recognize and regulate emotional states, potentially aiding those struggling with [[Social Cues]] and emotional awareness.
- EEG-based systems primarily detect internal emotional states but may not effectively interpret [[Social Disinhibition]], which influences online interactions and real-world empathy.
