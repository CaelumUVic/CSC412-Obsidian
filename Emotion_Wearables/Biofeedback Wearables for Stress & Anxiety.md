# Biofeedback Wearables for Stress & Anxiety

## Summary

Biofeedback wearables are a subset of **emotion-aware technology** designed to monitor **autonomic nervous system responses** and provide **real-time interventions**. These devices work by tracking physiological markers such as **heart rate variability (HRV), electrodermal activity (EDA), skin temperature, and muscle tension**.

Biofeedback training is increasingly used in **clinical psychology, workplace wellness programs, and mindfulness training** to help individuals develop greater emotional control and stress resilience.

## Applications & Use Cases

- **Clinical Therapy & PTSD Management:** Biofeedback wearables provide guided relaxation and emotional self-regulation strategies, making them effective tools for trauma recovery.
- **Workplace Wellness & Productivity:** Organizations are incorporating biofeedback wristbands and smart rings to monitor employee **cognitive load and stress levels**.
- **Athletic Performance & Recovery:** Athletes utilize biofeedback for HRV-based recovery analysis, helping them optimize training intensity and **avoid overtraining syndrome**.
- **Education & Cognitive Training:** Some studies suggest that students using biofeedback-assisted focus training demonstrate higher engagement and cognitive retention.


## Discussion

- Biofeedback wearables help individuals become more attuned to their emotional responses, improving [[Cognitive Empathy]] by making them aware of their emotional state and its impact on others.
- These tools focus on self-awareness but often lack direct tools to enhance [[Perspective-Taking]] or social interaction.
